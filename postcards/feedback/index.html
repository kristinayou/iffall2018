<h1>Feedback for Katie</h1>
<p> 1. The color and style of text works well against background. </p>
<p> 2. The placement of text gets a bit tight for the mobile version especially for the 2nd and 3rd postcards. </p>
<p> 3.Image for the last postcard is pixelated, so you might want to find a new image. </p>
<p> 4. The line breaks for the 1st and last postcards are really nice but the 2nd feels a bit awkward in borth versions. </p>
<p>5. Like you did for the first postcard, maybe the width of the text could get narrower for the mobile versions for the other two as well. </p>
<p>6. Try experimenting with different placements of text as the viewing size gets smaller? </p>
<p>7. Image for the mobile version of the second postcard feels a bit tight with the text- maybe add some room to the top. </p>
