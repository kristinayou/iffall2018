<h4>
I can lay inside<br>
I can lay inside<br>
I can lay inside<br>
I can lay inside
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Can't you bare just one more night?<br>
I can lay inside<br>
I can lay inside<br>
Can't you bare just one more night?<br>
I wanna be with you<br>
I wanna be used<br>
Can't you bare just one more night?<br>
I can lay inside<br>
You know I'll hold you tight<br>
Can't you bare just one more night?<br>
I wanna be with you<br>
I wanna be used
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

I hope you feel used<br>
And cope the way you do<br>
Should conjure up abuse<br>
Select your loss, slip to lose<br>
Just to get the muse<br>
There's no new news here<br>
This world, it doesn't hold a fear<br>
This girl, she doesn't hold a tear in my head<br>
The brain lives on but the vibes are dead<br>
Corrosively tread through emotionally spoon fed purpose<br>
Hel me as the worthless<br>
A surplus, blank, white surface<br>
Hel me as the worthless<br>
A surplus, blank, white surface<br>
Hel me as the worthless
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

I can lay inside<br>
I can lay inside<br>
Can't you bear just one more night?<br>
I can lay inside<br>
I can lay inside<br>
Can't you bear just one more night?<br>
I wanna be with you<br>
I wanna be used<br>
Can't you bear just one more night?<br>
I can lay inside<br>
You know I'd hold you tight<br>
Can't you bear just one more night?<br>
I wanna be with you<br>
I wanna be used
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

I can stay in your mind<br>
Wish me to stay away<br>
But no sign tells me to stay, when others say<br>
Some cats flee to see<br>
On the lap of deceit<br>
When true blue love means<br>
This faithful dissolve<br>
This melting control can be solved<br>
The soft touch, the hopes, the souls<br>
To one another, dear lover<br>
Dear brother<br>
Dear brother<br>
Cause there's still life to be lived in hell<br>
Can we lose our emotions and still live well?<br>
Can you tell that this faith is changed?<br>
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways<br>
Can you tell that this face is changed?<br>
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I could stay in your mind<br>
Wish me to stray away<br>
But leave me no sign, tell me to stay, when others say<br>
I could stay in your mind<br>
Wish me to stray away<br>
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay, when others say<br>
I could stay in your mind<br>
Wish me to stray away<br>
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay, when others say<br>
I could stay in your mind<br>
I could stay in your mind<br>
